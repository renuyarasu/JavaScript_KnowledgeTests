const a = 5;
console.log(+-a); // -5

/* 
Explanation:

In this example, we used unary + . Such a plus + does not change the number (Number) in any way. But if the operand is not a number, the unary plus will convert it to a number.
5 is a number. The unary + does not convert it in any way, so -5 will be printed to the console . */
