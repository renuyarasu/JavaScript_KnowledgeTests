The global property Infinity is a numeric value representing infinity.

Infinity is a property of the global object, that is, it is a variable in the global scope.

The initial value of Infinity is Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY . The value of Infinity ( positive infinity ) is greater than any other number, including positive infinity itself. This value behaves like a mathematical infinity ; for example, any positive number multiplied by Infinity gives Infinity, and any number divided by Infinity gives 0.
