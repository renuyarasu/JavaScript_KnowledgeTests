let num = 10;
console.log(num != 10 ? 'Yes' : 'No'); // No

/* 
Explanation:

In this problem, the ternary operator was used. Its syntax is: let result = condition ? value1 : value2;

If the condition is true, then value 1 is returned, otherwise value 2. In our condition , 10 != 10 is false , therefore the second value is returned, and this is No*/
