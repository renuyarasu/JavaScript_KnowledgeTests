The if statement executes the statement if the specified condition is true (true). If the condition is not met (false), then another instruction can be executed.

Syntax:
- A condition is an expression that is either true or false.
- Instruction1 - instruction to be executed if the "condition" value is true. Can be any statement including nested if. A block ({...}) is used to group multiple statements. When no action is required, an empty statement can be used.
- Instruction2 - an instruction to be executed if the "condition" value is false. Can be any statement, including nested if. Instructions can also be grouped into a block. */
