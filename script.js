/* 
The get syntax associates a property of an object with a function that will be called when that property is accessed.

Sometimes it is desirable to allow access to a property that returns a dynamically calculated value, or you may want to reflect the state of an internal variable without the need for explicit method calls. In JavaScript, this can be done using a getter.

It is not possible to have a getter bound to a property and have that property actually contain a value at the same time, although it is possible to use a getter and setter in combination to create a pseudo-property type.

An example is shown in the picture. */
