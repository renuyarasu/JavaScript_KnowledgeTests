/* 
Explanation:

JavaScript is a dynamically typed language: we don't define the type of variables. Variables can be automatically converted from one type to another without our participation, which is called   implicit type casting . A cast is a conversion from one type to another.

In this example, JavaScript has converted the number   4   to a string so that the operation inside the function makes sense. JS then concatenated the two strings, and thus we got the answer 24 (string)
