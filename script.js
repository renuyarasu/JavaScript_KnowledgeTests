// encodeURI() ðŸ”¥
/* 
The encodeURI() method encodes a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) by replacing some characters with one, two, three, or four escape sequences representing the UTF-8 encoding of the character (the four escape sequences will only be used for characters consisting of two "surrogate" characters) .

The URI is assumed to be a complete URI, so the method does not encode reserved characters that have special meaning in the URI.

encodeURI replaces all characters except the following with the appropriate UTF-8 escape sequences

An example is shown in the picture. */
